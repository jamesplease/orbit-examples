# orbit-examples

This repository contains examples of using
[Orbit.js](https://github.com/orbitjs/orbit.js).

Orbit provides a simple interface for simplifying the complexities that arise in applications
that use multiple data stores, like a memory store, local storage, and/or an external store that is interacted with
through an API. In addition, it comes with out-of-the-box support for the [JSON API specification](http://jsonapi.org/).

### JSON API

The [JSON API specification](http://jsonapi.org/) provides a guide that, when followed, will drastically speed up development of
a RESTful APIs. Although Orbit does not require APIs that adhere to the JSON API specification, this repository will show
examples that interface with an API that does adhere to the spec.

If your API does not adhere to the specification, no worries. These examples will still be useful as an introduction to the
other features that Orbit provides.
